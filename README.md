[Discord but Worse](https://discord-but-worse.herokuapp.com/#/) is a clone of the browser version of the popular app [Discord](https://discord.com/). Discord is an instant messaging app that originally beat out Skype as the app of choice in the gaming world. Due to its intuitive design it now sees use outside of the gaming world and is even being used by businesses in place of other popular instant messaging apps like Slack. This clone seeks to cleanly mimic the basic functionalities of Discord.
